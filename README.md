# E-Commerce

Module 13 Challenge

## Description

For this weeks Challenge we had to clone starter code in order to create a backend version of an E-Commerce webpage. First node needs to be installed by entering: npm i. Than you log into mysql to source the db/schema file. After that you need to run the command npm run seeds in order to seed the database. After all of that you need to add all the routes to the perspected route js file.
